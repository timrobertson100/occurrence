 * Annotation that defines a faceted field. The field corresponds to the name of it in the index
 * data store or in the model object. The name is the actual name of the facet, this field is used
 * to naming the facet in consistent way without dependencies of the field name. The intended use of
 * name is that it should contain values coming from literal names of a enumerated type (e.g:
 * Enum.name()).
